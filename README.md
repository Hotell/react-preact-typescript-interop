# React - Preact Typescript interop

This repo contains custom preact and preact-compat type definitions,
which are needed for any real life application using Preact with Typescript

As preact team is way to slow to accept any extensive TS type defs tweaks, customization is needed on your own.

Good news though! You don't need to look any futher. Just checkout the copy and Copy Pasta. Obey your Master. Master! ðŸŽ¶ðŸ––
